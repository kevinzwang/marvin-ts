`You\'re a demon slayer (or a group of demon slayers) who fights demons who have arrived at a village!
                    
Each village is occupied by certain amount of demons that your group must kill before the sun sets! To kill a demon, you must send a word that matches the pattern described for each village.
        
**Warning**: if a player says an incorrect word or a word that has already been said, they lose and do not get any points for that village! 
(Note: messages with only alphabetic characters and dashes are accepted, the rest will be ignored.)
        
Points are awarded for each demon slayed and for being the last one standing!`
